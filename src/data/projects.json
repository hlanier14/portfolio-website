        "subtitle": "Have you ever needed to book a Global Entry appointment? I have, and the next available interview in the entire state of Illinois was three months into the future. Not wanting to constantly check TTP's site for closer open timeslots, I built a scanner to automatically alert me via email and SMS when timeslots open up at nearby locations. I am in the process of making the scanner available to others looking for a Global Entry appointment.",

We gathered, cleaned, and analyzed weather forecast and geographic data on 160 cities. In December 2022, the dataset was selected by Tidy Tuesday for its weekly data wrangling and visualization challenge.",
