        "subtitle": "Have you ever needed to book a Global Entry appointment? I have, and the next available interview in the entire state of Illinois was three months into the future. Not wanting to constantly check TTP's site for closer open timeslots, I built a scanner to automatically alert me via email and SMS when timeslots open up at nearby locations. I am in the process of making the scanner available to others looking for a Global Entry appointment.",
